### Inspiration

This project was inspired by the YouTube video titled Build a Shopping Cart with JavaScript YouTube Video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT_ZYrS3tKc), created by freeCodeCamp.org. The video provided valuable ideas that influenced the development of this project.

This is a learning project so I would greatly appreciate any feedback you may have. Please feel free to reach out to me.
